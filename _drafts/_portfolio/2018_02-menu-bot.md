## What is it?
My roommate and I grew tired of accessing our school cafeteria's web menu whenever we wanted to know what there was to eat, so I wrote a Google Actions app to do it for us! The app has earned the Gaining Traction achievement from the [Google Developer Community](https://developers.google.com/actions/community/), with several thousand uses on average in the first couple months of deployment. 

Thank you to Google for sending me a free [Google Home](https://store.google.com/ca/product/google_home)!

## What I did
I wrote a web scraper using BeautifulSoup in Python for use in a Flask app, hosted on Heroku, which I linked to my Dialogflow model.

## Technology stack
* Python (BeautifulSoup)
* Flask
* Heroku
* Dialogflow
