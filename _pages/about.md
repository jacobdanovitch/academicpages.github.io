Hi, I'm Jacob. I'm a data science intern at Microsoft Cortana. This past summer, I worked on using deep learning to extract suggested meetings from emails in Outlook, and extended this to develop a classification model for multi-turn conversations.

During the school year, I take honors computer science at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. I'm entering the senior year of my undergraduate degree, and I've been accepted to the 5-year masters track - with a concentration in data science - at the [Ottawa-Carleton Institute of Computer Science](https://carleton.ca/scs/mcs-accelerated-stream/). My coursework focuses on deep learning, information retrieval, and knowledge graphs. I'm also a TA for courses like Introduction to Web Development and [Storytelling with Data](http://www.davidmckie.com/professional-skills-data-storytelling-33310-jour-4401-a/).

I am currently looking to gain strong research experience to prepare for graduate studies, with the goal of becoming a research scientist. You can find my work [here](/research/). My general research interests include stylistic variation in conversations, malicious interactions on social media, and machine learning in sports (primarily NBA/MLB).

* <b>August 16, 2019:</b> My [work](/twtc), <i style="font-style: italic">Trouble with the Curve: Predicting Future MLB Players Using Scouting Reports</i>, was accepted to the [2019 Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Conference](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/)! I'll be presenting my poster there in November.
* <b>July 26, 2019:</b> I completed my second software engineering internship at Microsoft. Next summer, I'll be returning as a data scientist intern!
