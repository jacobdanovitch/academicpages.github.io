Hi, I'm Jacob. I'm a data science intern at Microsoft Cortana. During the school year, I take honors computer science at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. I'm entering the senior year of my undergraduate degree, and I've been accepted to the 5-year masters track - with a concentration in data science - at the [Ottawa-Carleton Institute of Computer Science](https://carleton.ca/scs/mcs-accelerated-stream/). My coursework focuses on deep learning, information retrieval, and knowledge graphs. I'm also a TA for courses like Introduction to Web Development and [Storytelling with Data](http://www.davidmckie.com/professional-skills-data-storytelling-33310-jour-4401-a/).


I am currently looking to gain strong research experience to prepare for graduate studies, with the goal of becoming a research scientist. You can find my work [here](/research/). Right now, I'm exploring [stylistic variations](/research/cu-disinfo) in malicious social media content. This past summer, I used deep learning to extract meeting suggestions from Outlook emails, and extended this to develop a [classification model](/research/remembert) for multi-turn conversations. I also work on applications of machine learning to sports (primarily NBA/MLB).
