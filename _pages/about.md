Hi, I'm Jacob. I'm an incoming Master's student in Machine Learning at <a href="http://mila.quebec/en" class="btn btn--icon btn--inverse" style="width: 5rem"><i class="fac fa-mila fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i> MILA</a> and data science intern at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/msai/" class="btn btn--icon btn--inverse"><img class="icon--custom" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Microsoft_logo.svg" style="transform: translate(-1px, -1px);"> Microsoft Search, Assistant and Intelligence</a>. This summer, I'll be graduating from the honors computer science program at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, where I worked with my wonderful supervisor Professor [Majid Komeili](http://people.scs.carleton.ca/~majidkomeili/) and TA'd for courses like Introduction to Web Development and [Storytelling with Data](http://www.davidmckie.com/professional-skills-data-storytelling-33310-jour-4401-a-2/).

I'll be starting my MSc. in the fall (online, for now!) with Professor [Reihaneh Rabbany](http://www.reirab.com/).

## What I'm Up To

* Socially distancing
* [Research](/publications/)
  * Extending my [senior thesis](/publications/thesis) (code+paper coming soon).
  * I also work on information retrieval and applications of machine learning to sports (primarily NBA/MLB).

## Updates

* **June 1, 2020**: Started a data science internship at Microsoft.
* **May 12, 2020:** Here are the results of my graduate school applications as well as some supporting materials, for anyone who feels unsure about the process like I did. [(repo)](https://github.com/jacobdanovitch/Graduate-Applications)
* **March 13, 2020:** I got engaged!
* **2019**:
  * **August**: My [work](/publications/twtc), <i style="font-style: italic">Trouble with the Curve: Predicting Future MLB Players Using Scouting Reports</i>, was a finalist in the reproducible research competition at the the [2019 Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Conference](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/).
  * **July**: I completed my second internship at Microsoft (MSAI), using deep learning to extract meeting suggestions from Outlook emails.This was part of a larger project, for which a patent is pending.
