Hi, I'm Jacob. I'm a software engineering intern at Microsoft Cortana. During the school year, I take honors computer science at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, where I'm entering my senior year. As well, I've been admitted to the accelerated masters in computer science - with a concentration in data science - at the [Ottawa-Carleton Institute of Computer Science](https://carleton.ca/scs/mcs-accelerated-stream/).
