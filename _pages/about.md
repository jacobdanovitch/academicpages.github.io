Hi, I'm Jacob. I'm a software engineering intern at Microsoft Cortana. This summer, I'm working on using deep learning to extract suggested meetings (including time, location, attendees, etc.) from emails in Outlook. 

During the school year, I take honors computer science at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, where I'm entering the senior year of my undergraduate degree. As well, I'm working towards a 5-year masters in computer science - with a concentration in data science - at the [Ottawa-Carleton Institute of Computer Science](https://carleton.ca/scs/mcs-accelerated-stream/). My coursework focuses on deep learning, information retrieval, and knowledge graphs.

I am currently looking to gain strong research experience to prepare for graduate studies, with the goal of becoming a research scientist. You can find my work [here](/research/). My general research interests include: 

* Conversation analysis
* Disinformation on social media
* Augmenting NLP models/representations with structured data
* Machine learning in sports (primarily NBA/MLB)
