Hi, I'm Jacob. I'm a data science intern at Microsoft Cortana. This past summer, I worked on using deep learning to extract suggested meetings from emails in Outlook, and extended this to develop a classification model for multi-turn conversations.

During the school year, I take honors computer science at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. I'm entering the senior year of my undergraduate degree, and I've been accepted to the 5-year masters track - with a concentration in data science - at the [Ottawa-Carleton Institute of Computer Science](https://carleton.ca/scs/mcs-accelerated-stream/). My coursework focuses on deep learning, information retrieval, and knowledge graphs.

I am currently looking to gain strong research experience to prepare for graduate studies, with the goal of becoming a research scientist. You can find my work [here](/research/). My general research interests include: 

* Linguistic variation in person-to-person conversation
* Disinformation on social media
* Augmenting NLP models/representations with structured data
* Machine learning in sports (primarily NBA/MLB)
