Hi, I'm Jacob. I'm a software engineering intern at Microsoft Cortana. During the school year, I take honors computer science at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, where I'm entering the senior year of my undergraduate degree. As well, I'm working towards an accelerated masters in computer science - with a concentration in data science - at the [Ottawa-Carleton Institute of Computer Science](https://carleton.ca/scs/mcs-accelerated-stream/).

My current focus is on gaining strong research experience to prepare for graduate studies; you can find my current work [here](/research/). My general interests include interpreting the linguistic properties of embeddings, analyzing discourse at an author level, and a couple of fun basketball ideas I'd like to explore. In the long term, becoming a research scientist is my primary goal.
