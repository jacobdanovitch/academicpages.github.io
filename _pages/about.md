Hi, I'm Jacob. I'm a data science intern at Microsoft Cortana. During the school year, I take honors computer science at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. I'm entering the senior year of my undergraduate degree, and I've been accepted to the 5-year masters track - with a concentration in data science - at the [Ottawa-Carleton Institute of Computer Science](https://carleton.ca/scs/mcs-accelerated-stream/). My coursework focuses on deep learning, information retrieval, and knowledge graphs. I'm also a TA for courses like Introduction to Web Development and [Storytelling with Data](http://www.davidmckie.com/professional-skills-data-storytelling-33310-jour-4401-a/).

## What I'm Up To

* I am currently applying to graduate programs. 
* I'm involved in [research](/research/) at my school and independently.
  * I'm currently writing my [senior thesis](/research/thesis) about incorporating human instructions into NLP models.
  * I also work on applications of machine learning to sports (primarily NBA/MLB).

## Updates

* <b>August 16, 2019:</b> My [work](/research/twtc), <i style="font-style: italic">Trouble with the Curve: Predicting Future MLB Players Using Scouting Reports</i>, was accepted to the [2019 Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Conference](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/)!    
  * <b>Update 10/2019:</b> I'll be presenting a 15-minute talk as a finalist in the reproducible research competition!
* <b>July 26, 2019:</b> I completed my second internship at Microsoft (MSAI). 
  * My work used deep learning to extract meeting suggestions from Outlook emails, and extended this to develop a [classification model](/research/remembert) for multi-turn conversations. This was part of a larger project, for which a patent is pending.
  * I'll be returning as a data scientist intern next summer!
