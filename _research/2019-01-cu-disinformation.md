The goal of this ongoing project is to construct a novel annotated dataset of tweets pertaining to politically polarizing Canadian news events mined from Twitter. We recently developed a [method](/research/newslinking) to accelerate the construction of our dataset. In the future, we hope to explore the narratives and cues used by malicious actors to spread disinformation.
