<!-- Do Human-Written Explanations Make Neural Attention More Interpretable? -->

Supervised by: [Professor Majid Komeili](http://people.scs.carleton.ca/~majidkomeili/)

<!-- We propose a novel method for text classification with improved local post-hoc interpretability without compromising performance by learning from human-written rationales.  We demonstrate that deriving attention scores from the rationales leads to stronger correlations with human judgements than previous works. Our code is made publically available on [GitHub]().

Will be posted after ICML workshop notification.
