# Evaluation

.middle-content[
The main draw of HashGNN is that retrieval can be performed in sublinear time, using an inverted index or approximate k-Nearest Neighbors index (especially those optimized for sparse and/or integer data). The top $k$ candidates are retrieved by Hamming distance, the minimum edit distance between two bit-strings.

This is significantly more efficient than pairwise approaches - which must make a prediction for each candidate in the collection - and slightly more efficient than approximate kNN for continuous data (but much more space-efficient).
