excerpt: "Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computers use in order to perform a specific task effectively without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. This course will cover advanced topics in machine learning such as deep learning, transfer learning, multiview learning, clustering and Interpretability of ML methods."

## Description

Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computers use in order to perform a specific task effectively without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. This course will cover advanced topics in machine learning such as deep learning, transfer learning, multiview learning, clustering and Interpretability of ML methods.

## Content

**Professor**: Majid Komeili

**Grade**: in progress

### Projects

The course is primarily project-based, with two assignments as well as a major research project. The assignments focused on:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks
2. Triplet loss

For the research project, I chose to explore large-scale relevance matching using tens of thousands of Tweets and associated news articles. You can check out my work [here](/research/newslinking).

### Presentations

The course also included presentations of two conference papers about a variety of topics. I chose to focus on interpretability in deep learning, and presented [Attention is not Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10186) as part of a small survey on the interpretability of the attention mechanism.
