## Content

**Professor**: Caroline Barri√®re

**Grade**: A

### Projects

A hands-on approach to the course was emphasized, with the majority of the coursework being assignment-based. These assignments were substantial and interesting, covering topics such as:

1. RDF and `SPARQL`
2. Ontology Design
3. Ontology Reasoning and Matching
4. Ontology Learning

### Presentations

The course also included two presentations. The objective of the first was to explore any tool or public work related to the semantic web, RDF, or `SPARQL`. I chose [pbprdf](https://github.com/andrewstellman/pbprdf), an open-source project providing access to NBA play-by-play data in turtle format that can easily be queried in SPARQL. My page for this presentation is [here](/talks/2019-02-csi5180).

The objective of the second was to present a summary of a conference tutorial from a recent instance of [ISWC](https://iswc2019.semanticweb.org/) or [ESWC](https://2019.eswc-conferences.org/). I chose [_HybridNLP2018 - Tutorial on Hybrid Techniques for Knowledge-based NLP_](https://github.com/HybridNLP2018/tutorial), which discussed the augmentation of word embeddings with external, structured knowledge sources.
