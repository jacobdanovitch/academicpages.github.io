## Content

**Professor**: Caroline Barri√®re

**Grade**: A

### Projects

The focus of the course was to learn in a hands-on way by using the lecture content to build our own search engine. This included using vector space and boolean models of information retrieval, implmenting user-facing features such as spelling correction, and more. My continued work on this project lives [here](/portfolio/2019_02-joogle/).

### Tests

There were four quizzes throughout the course, covering:

1. Boolean and Vector Space retrieval models
2. Language models, Probabilistic models, Query Completion, Model evaluation
3. Machine learning (supervised and unsupervised), Query completion
4. PageRank, Web crawling

### Research Project

The final component of the course was an independent research project, within which we presented a 6 minute talk and authored a written report. The page for my talk is [here](/talks/2019-03-csi4107) (though most of the slide content is visual).
