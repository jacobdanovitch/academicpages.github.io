## What is it?

Our midyear assignment in my journalism elective required my journalism professor to group 120 students by hand. I offered to streamline this process by creating an algorithm to group students for my professor.

## What I did
By using anonymized responses to a class-wide survey and implementing a clustering algorithm using Hamming distance, I implemented a reusable algorithm that saved my professor many hours while maintaining strong student performance. 

## Technology stack
* pandas
* numpy
* sk-learn
* seaborn
* matplotlib

## I learned
This was my first project with a strict and short-term deadline, which taught me how to balance coding efficiently to meet deadlines, and coding robustly to create an effective result.
