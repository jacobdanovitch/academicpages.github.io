(used for COMP1406 in Winer 2018)

A very basic website for a recurring computer science study group. This group, led by [Tim Elliott](https://github.com/TimJElliott) and I as volunteers, meets weekly to help our classmates do as well as possible.

Using this site, a Carleton student can sign-up, check-in for our study sessions, and keep track of how many they've been to for their co-curricular credit.
